## Habit Tracker App

Frontend folder contains React application. Backend folder is Django REST framework. 

For users, the intention is to add habits in the My Goals page, then complete a Daily Checkin for several weeks and View Progress to monitor if implementing a new habit/health tip/whatever changes your energy/mood/sleep in a positive or negative way. This is all very pseudoscientific of course. I intend to eventually add a more intelligent data analysis component to REALLY delve into correllations between the habit consistency and daily check in tables. But first I need to study some statistics (Sadly, I opted for calculus instead while in school). I will also be adding a social media component soon.)

This was designed as a capstone project for DevCodeCamp fullstack flex bootcamp.
